# SnakeGame_in_Java
While learning java I decided to make the snake game...
Features of the game:
  - Creates new apple once existing one is eaten
  - Increments the length of the snake onc a point is scored by eating the apple.
  - The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries or itself.
  - The game gets faster as the snake eats more apples.

This is s demo of how the game looks like
